# xubuntu-command-line-git
Hands-on experimentation with Git commands in a Xubuntu environment, focusing on mastering version control and CLI operations.

Working through The Odin Project and applying what I learnt with each project.

# Project Goals
- Begin working on projects from this point onward in a Linux environment (Xubuntu)
- Use the CLI for all Git-related operations
